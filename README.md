# FTC_tests

Your goal for this short project is to create some test OP modes for our robot.

The goal is to get acquainted with the library documentation and Java in real life

## Instructions 

NOTE: at the end of class with your file in the format even if you did not finish **yourname_test1.java**

1. First I would like you to make a very simple op mode that will move to the robot based on the user's controller input (check the FTC examples first file).
2. Then please ensure that you understand each line if not take note and we will go over it later or preferably ask your teammates 
3. Make an effort to understand lines 115 and 116 on the example (you will need to use docs)
4. Invert the controls
5. add a new motor that moves faster than the others
